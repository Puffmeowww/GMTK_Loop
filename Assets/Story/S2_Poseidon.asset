  - "He never liked her. \\n She smiled at everyone, gave flowers to the old, snacks
    to the children. \\n Bribery, he thought, with a sneer. \\n Sometimes, she would
    greet him. \u201CHi, the weather's nice today, perfect for a walk, isn't it?\u201D "
  - He hated her, hated her with a burning, reckless fury. \n Since he could think,
    he had devoured books and poems, believed he was destined for greatness. \n And
    her? She was nothing but a village girl. \n Probably couldn't count past the
    number of pigs in her family's pen.
  - 'At the campaign rally, <b><color=#1E90FF><size=120%>he actually lost to her.
    </size></color></b> \n She walked toward him, bathed in cheers, smiling as she
    spoke. \n Her smile burned into his eyes. '
  - 'He couldn''t remember what she said, only the faces mocking him. \n People drank
    the new brew to celebrate, and he drowned his days in whiskey. \n Those fools
    will burn in hell, he thought. '
  - 'He stumbled through the alleys late at night, since this place was clearly hell,
    but somehow didn''t look like hell. He decided to add the flames. \n <b><color=#1E90FF><size=120%>He
    burned down the village. </size></color></b> \n The fire swallowed everything,
    and he laughed madly among the blaze, like a devil risen from hell itself. '
  - 'The village rose again from the ashes. \n The fallen houses were lifted by her
    strong arms, and the people''s smiles saved by her haunting songs. \n <b><color=#1E90FF><size=120%>She
    made this place beautiful and fertile. </size></color></b> '
  - "No one knew it was him. \\n People only called him a madman. He laughed loudly,
    telling everyone he set the fire, but they just drove him away with disgust.
    \\n He knew no one would ever see him again, never witness his poems, his strategies,
    his arts and letters. \\n <b><color=#1E90FF><size=120%>He had lost to her\u2014forever.

    their bright, lively mayor could be gone. So they built her a new house. \n He
    finally became a great man, a man of honor. <b><color=#1E90FF><size=120%>He made

    him, they only sighed.'
