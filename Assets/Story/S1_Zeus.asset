  - "<b><color=#FFD700><size=120%>He noticed something.</size></color></b> \\n A
    thread, a fracture\u2014everything left a trace. \\n He, like all boys, tried
    to decipher the silence in his father\u2019s deep gaze. \\n A friend once told
    him: \"If you look hard enough, you\u2019ll find a sliver of love behind the
    sternness.\" \\n So he watched his father in secret. \\n And with pride, he shared
    his small triumphs, as if laying medals at the feet of a statue. \\n His father\u2019s
    eyes? Like blades. Sharp. Unyielding. Reflecting nothing but the boy's own trembling
    reflection. \\n "
  - "That night, the rain and the knocking never stopped. \\n <b><color=#FFD700><size=120%>He
    was hidden.</size></color></b> His mother shoved a rag into his mouth. \\n He
    struggled to breathe. The tears wouldn\u2019t stop. \\n He didn\u2019t understand
    her actions. \\n Or maybe he did. Maybe he just didn\u2019t want to believe it.
    \\n But he knew he would believe her. He always would. \\n He begged, for everything
    to end, end quickly."
  - "When at last the silence held only the rain. \\n He was met by bloodstains,
    and a mother unrecognizable. \\n His father sat, stunned, on the floor. \\n For
    the first time, he saw his father\u2014 so small, so fragile."
  - "<b><color=#FFD700><size=120%>The head was severed.</size></color></b> \\n He
    threw the axe to the ground, and left the village forever. \\n The one who cut
    off his father\u2019s head feared nothing anymore. He walked away, like a hero."
  - Twenty years later, he was defeated once again. \n His wife, meek and quiet,
    prepared the meal in a way that ignited his irritation. \n His daughter had inherited
    none of his heroic fire so painfully ordinary it made him sick. \n He watched
    her closely. She tried desperately to hide her fear.
