  SuccessStoryText:
  - "She left. \\n No reason. No plan. Just a whisper\u2014quiet and sudden, blooming
    like smoke in her chest:  \\n \"Go. Just go.\"  \\nSo she did. Not to escape.
    Not to arrive. Just to move, as if motion alone could mean something again."
  - "She\u2019s not the kind to indulge in luxuries\u2014 not even a walk.  But tonight\u2026
    the wind feels like silk brushing her skin, and the moon\u2014 the moon isn\u2019t
    watching.  It\u2019s listening.  Everything is soft. Too soft. As if the city,
    just for a moment, forgot how cruel it is."
  - "He opened the door. The handle still warm, a trace of hesitation left behind\u2014
    as if the one who left hadn\u2019t quite made up their mind.  He turned away,
    like a man who discovered his friend wasn\u2019t home. Ordinary.  But there\u2019s
    no pause in him.  He\u2019ll find the next. And the next. Until those twisted
    thoughts are fed\u2014 until the hunger goes silent."
  - "Much later, she returned home.  She sat in the chair\u2014 for a long, long
    time.  The walls hadn\u2019t shifted. The air was the same.  No trace of fate\u2019s
    passing.  As if nothing had happened. As if the world had politely declined to
    notice."
  FailStoryText:
  - "She\u2019s home. The alley\u2014quiet as always, draped in the same old poverty.
    She counts the money she scraped together today. Not much. Just enough to stay
    barely breathing in this place. Under the dim, flickering light, it hits her.
    She is already dead. Not the kind of death with flowers and mourning\u2014 The
    kind where something inside just\u2026 stops. And no one notices."
  - "He slips through the alley\u2014 smooth, silent, a black cat in human skin. 
    The woman doesn't flinch. Doesn\u2019t move. There\u2019s no fear in her posture.
    Just stillness. As if she\u2019s waiting. Not for him. For fate. Like someone
    who already heard the knock, and left the door ajar."
  - "She didn\u2019t scream. No rage. No fear in her eyes. Just\u2026 absence.  He
    wasn\u2019t killing a person. He was unmaking something that had already withered. 
    The room\u2014bare, silent, unblinking\u2014 bore witness to nothing. Not even
    death dared speak."
  - "This wasn\u2019t his first kill. And it sure as hell won\u2019t be the last. 
    The act no longer trembles in his hands. It slides in, cold and practiced\u2014
    like lighting a cigarette or locking a door behind him.  Just another night.
    Just another shadow swallowed."
